### About Me
I'm a Python developer that loves to mess around with iOS devices!

### Projects
- [Inferius](https://github.com/marijuanARM/Inferius/) - A tool for creating & restoring custom IPSWs onto an iOS device, similarly to xpwn.
- [homebrew-discord](https://github.com/marijuanARM/homebrew-discord/) - A discord bot to fetch package information using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) API.
- [ios-tools](https://github.com/marijuanARM/ios-tools/) - A repository for various Python scripts that are related to iOS jailbreaking.
- [AutoTSS](https://github.com/marijuanARM/autotss/) - A blob saver based on [codsane's autotss](https://github.com/codsane/autotss) that can save blobs for multiple devices, and saves OTA/Beta blobs too!
- [Criptam](https://github.com/marijuanARM/Criptam/) - A tool to automate decrypting/saving/uploading Firmware Keys for iOS devices

### Contributions
- I've ported multiple packages to [Procursus](https://github.com/ProcursusTeam/Procursus/), a modern iOS bootstrap with frequently updated UNIX tools.
- I help maintain [Sileo's Featured Page](https://github.com/Sileo/featuredpage/), which is a curated page of tweaks & themes for all jailbroken iOS devices that use Sileo.
